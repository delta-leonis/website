                <p>Tomorrow, you will be released. If you are bored of brawling with thieves and want to achieve something there is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes. Pick one of these flowers. If you can carry it to the top of the mountain, you may find what you were looking for in the first place.
I had a vision of a world without Batman. The Mob ground out a little profit and the police tried to shut them down one block at a time. And it was so boring. I’ve had a change of heart. I don’t want Mr Reese spoiling everything but why should I have all the fun? Let’s give someone else a chance. If Coleman Reese isn’t dead in 60 minutes then I blow up a hospital.
You wanna know how I got these scars? My father was… a drinker, and a fiend. And one night, he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn’t like that, not one bit. So, me watching he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me and he says: “Why so serious?”. He comes at me with the knife “Why so serious?”. He sticks the blade in my mouth. “Let’s put a smile on that face.” and… Why so serious?</p>
